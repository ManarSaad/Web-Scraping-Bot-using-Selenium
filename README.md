# Web-Scraping-Bot-using-Selenium
Web Scraping Bot, Browser Automation using Selenium. 
This project is a re-write few lines script of link  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7VZsCCnptM">here</a> as some of the updates were made on selenium syntax, and booking website interface, Hence, the exact code in the link tutorial will not achieve the goal, and as many learners stop the process of learning when the contents are outdated, I decided to update the script and enjoy the result.




## Getting Started: 
1-	IDE that runs python scripts.<br>
2-	Download chrome web driver, learn more here <br>
3-	Download selenium package.<br>
4-	Basic knowledge of OOP programming.<br>
