This project is a re-write few lines script of link as some of the updates were made on selenium syntax, and booking website interface, that the exact code in the link tutorial will not achieve the goal, and as many learners stop the process of learning when the contents are outdated, I decided to update the script and enjoy the result, all  the scripts is completely to link.
